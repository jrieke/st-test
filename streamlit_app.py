# We could also use this to allow delta generator + return value usage! Something like:

# ```python
# number = st.slider(...)
# st.write(number)
# number.text_input(...)
# ```

# Not sure if that improves Streamlit so much. Delta generators are hardly used anyway.
# But it would kinda nicely unify our API. No mix between delta generators and other
# values. Every return value can just be used as a delta generator.

# More advanced but maybe you can even use this to change the widget on the fly? E.g. you
# can do:

# ```python
# number.set(42)

# And this would send an update proto to the frontend that updates the number of the
# widget. Might be weird if the app takes a long time to run and then things change later
# on. But it definitely is super easy to understand!

# Would simplify our old coupled sliders example to:

# ```python
# celsius = st.slider("Celsius", 0, 100, 0)
# fahrenheit = st.slider("Fahrenheit", 0, 212, 32)

# if celsius.changed():
#     fahrenheit.set(celsius * 9 / 5 + 32)
# elif fahrenheit.changed():
#     celsius.set((fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9)
# ```

# No callbacks, just a straightforward Python script!

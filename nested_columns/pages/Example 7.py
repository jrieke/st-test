# Example 7
https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/support-for-nested-columns/28810

This is a super complex layout. It requires 2 levels of nesting and I even left out 
a few details of the original request. We shouldn't support this!

# Takeaways
# - Yeah, this is way too complex for a Streamlit app.
# - Side note: dataframe doesn't resize if sidebar is collapsed, we should fix that (with use_container_width=True).
# - It also looks weird on small screen sizes. Because there are so many columns,
#   they naturally become very small. So if you make the window small, they become tiny,
#   which makes things look weird. E.g the text in the top left gets stretched out vertically way too much.
#   And the images on the right side don't have the same height as the rest of the content any more.
# - On mobile it's OK actually since everything is just below each other. The toolbar on the
#   left looks weird but OK, can't really change that much.
